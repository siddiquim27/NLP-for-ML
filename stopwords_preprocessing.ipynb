In the last 5 years, I would have\n"," interacted with many High Courts and the Supreme Court for more than 15 times on various occasions.\n","  I am very happy that substantial progress has been made in the courts to improve the justice delivery system\n","  such as specific efforts for bringing down the pendency of cases, fast settlement of cases especially pertaining\n","   to women and children and the use of technology for handling certain special cases. I also see the\n","    websites of various courts and I am convinced that the courts are constantly improving the systems and\n","    procedures using ICT tools and are making timely information available to people thus ensuring courts\n","    are friendly to citizens. I appreciate the ?e-courts? efforts taken by the Supreme Court of India in\n","    three phases as a mission mode project under the National e-Governance Plan (NeGEP). It is planned to\n","     provide necessary infrastructure and concentrate on capacity building, judicial process from filing to\n","      execution and finally making the information available online between the courts, prosecuting and investigating\n","      agencies, prisons, land records and registration offices thereby accelerating disposal of civil and criminal cases.\n","      While you are concentrating on the computerization of courts for transforming them into e-Courts in three phases,\n","      I would like to focus on creating the e-judiciary by establishing the Judicial e-Governance grid from the district\n","       courts to the Apex Court, thereby creating a vertical e-Governance grid for covering the whole judicial system of\n","        the country. This Grid will ensure seamless flow of information and case objects across the inter-departmental barrier\n","        in a G2G mode across the vertical grid. This will be supported by the other horizontal e-Governance grid from the State\n","        and Central Government related to the particular case object which will facilitate the case objects to flow across\n","         judicial process at various stages ensuring the speed, transparency and inter-operability thereby eliminating duplicity\n","          and ensuring the speedy justice.
